__A blog by Heath Robertson where *CodeHappens*__

{% include gallery caption="Outdoor activites." %}

I grew up on a cattle ranch in remote west central Wyoming. I still live in the small mountain town in where my family homesteaded in the 1890s. I spend as much time in the outdoors; mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing and horseback riding with my family as I possibly can. 

My background is in marketing and graphic design. I have owned and operated small businesses for the last 15 years. As a designer I have spent time tinkering with my computing systems, both Mac and Linux, and playing with code. 

I have spent the last few years self-teaching programming from 5am to 7am every day, learning; Python, Bash, Docker, Haskell etc, as well as working my way through Udacityâ€™s AI for Finance Nanodegree and will complete the Blockchain Nanodegree in the near future. My current goal, aside from mapping out my self-teaching journey here, is to master smart contract design and development.

I have been fascinated by economics, finance, currency, and complex systems for many years. This curiosity and mental noodling exposed me to Bitcoin and I have been slowly working my way in to the decentralized blockchain space. I see tremendous opportunity in [Dapp][dapp]s and [DAO][dao]s. 

[Decentralized Trustless Networks][dtn] are an exciting new toolset with the potential to provide humanity much needed options in a rapidly developing information based economy.  The ability to control and manage your own data in a manner that suits your needs, could have a massive impact on our future.

A couple of things I am proud of, a happy family with twin boys and I built my own home.
