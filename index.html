<p>There is a race going on right now. Our virtual environment is solidifying. Pieces of the digital world are becoming, singular, ownable, and unhackable.</p>

<p>These parts of the digital world:</p>
<ul>
<li>can be transferred from one person to another at the speed of information;</li>
<li>are unique, can have value and are tradable;</li>
<li>can also behave as bookmarks for pieces of the physical world;</li>
<li>are programmable and contractually binding;</li>
<li>achieved without a fallible, expensive central authority or middle-men.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This race will result in the development of new protocols.  These protocols will do for ownership, governance and value, what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">internet protocols</a> like; HTTP, TCP, IP, and MAC did for the transfer of information. ToiletHill.io is an ongoing collection of posts and information relating to this change.
