<h2>Self-Teaching Programming</h2>
<p>
I've been self-teaching programming for a few years now. I've been keeping loose notes of everything that I've done.  I have performed thousands of Google searches, read through  an untold number of stackoverflow post, countless blog posts, documentation pages, GitHub readmes and code and watched YouTube videos at 1.75x speed.  All of this without knowing if the information that I was consuming was what I really needed.
</p>
<p>
There are many times that I backed up and ran over the same problem because I didn't document well enough or at all. It can also be quite tricky knowing what to document and what not to.  Having an outline or pathway, would have been a nice thing to start with.   I'm not saying that this is the best way or even the correct way, as a matter of fact it probably is not, but it is a way to get started programming.
</p>
<p>
What I have here at ToiletHill.io is a collection of tools that make up a foundation to start from.   If you're just starting out, welcome aboard I'm happy to help out any way I can. If you're an experienced programmer or developer and have suggestions, I am all ears, please contact me, I am happy to listen and eager to learn.  -Heath
