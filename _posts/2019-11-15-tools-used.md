What we will be doing is creating a development environment that uses networked
Docker containers running NixOs.  Generally I run a container with my
Integrated Development Environment (IDE), a second container running the
specific development environment for building the project and a data container
that carries the Nix packages.


What you will need:
1. Terminal App
2. Docker
